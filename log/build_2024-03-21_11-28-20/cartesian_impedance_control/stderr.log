[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmessages_fr3.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "messages_fr3", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "messages_fr3" with
  any of the following names:

    messages_fr3Config.cmake
    messages_fr3-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "messages_fr3" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "messages_fr3_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "messages_fr3" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
