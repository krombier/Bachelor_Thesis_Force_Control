# Wrench plotter in real time
### Made at Pd|Z

This program can plot a wrench published by another program in real time. Currently it isn't possible to safe the file but making screenshots of it works. Most of this was done with ChatGPT so there is high chance that it can be optimized and made more comprehensible.

Start the plotter:

```bash
ros2 run realtime_plot_of_data force_torque_plotter
```
